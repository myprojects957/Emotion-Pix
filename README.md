🎭 Emotionix – Emotion-Based Movie Recommendation System

Emotionix is an AI-powered web application developed by me that detects human facial emotions from images and recommends movies based on the detected emotional state. This project demonstrates my skills in Python, Flask, computer vision, machine learning integration, and full-stack web development.

🚀 Project Overview

I designed and built Emotionix to explore the practical application of emotion recognition using computer vision and to integrate it with a real-world recommendation system. The application captures facial images, analyzes emotions using a deep learning–based model, and maps the detected emotion to relevant movie genres using external APIs.

✨ Key Features

🔐 Implemented secure user authentication using Supabase

😊 Integrated facial emotion detection using FER (Facial Emotion Recognition)

🎬 Developed emotion-based movie recommendation logic

🔍 Implemented movie search functionality using IMDb API via RapidAPI

🎙️ Added voice-based movie search for enhanced usability

📷 Implemented camera on/off toggle for user privacy

🗄️ Designed an efficient SQLite caching system to reduce API calls and improve performance

🎯 Emotion-to-Genre Mapping Logic
Emotion	Genre
Happy	Comedy
Sad	Drama
Angry	Action
Surprise	Adventure
Neutral	Drama
Fear	Horror
📈 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:

Building full-stack web applications using Flask

Integrating machine learning models into production-ready APIs

Working with image processing and facial emotion recognition

API integration and response caching

Secure authentication and environment variable management

🚀 Deployment

The application is structured to be deployment-ready on cloud platforms such as Render. Environment variables are securely managed, and optional services degrade gracefully if unavailable.
